hi every one, i have installed phpmyadmin, when i put localhost/phpmyadmin in  a browser i get error,  Not Found The requested URL /phpmyadmin was not found on this server. Apache/2.2.20 (Ubuntu) Server at localhost Port 80  please help me fix this, thanks a lot 

ok, that is quite very easy to solve, hope you have correctly installed all the packages neccessary on linux for running phpmyadmin, good, if yes, now open terminal, 
1)  do you have a /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf file ?
2)  k-joseph, ok, open a terminal and run : sudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf &&     
    sudo service apache2 reload
3)   that's fine, you should be able to load phpmyadmin now
