	[14:52] <k-joseph> hi, i need your assistance so i can solve this problem am, it is standing a blocker,  
[14:53] <k-joseph> i think before-->> this.location.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId))   was used to set location, ?
[15:03] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: hi
[15:04] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  hi
[15:04] <k-joseph> [14:52] <k-joseph> hi, i need your assistance so ican solve this problem am, it is standing a blocker,  
[15:04] <k-joseph> [14:53] <k-joseph> i think before-->>this.location.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId))   was used to set location, ?
[15:04] <k-joseph> [15:03] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: hi
[15:04] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  do you know what this method does? equalsIgnoreCase()
[15:05] <k-joseph> Compares this String to another String, ignoring case considerations.
[15:07] <dkayiwa> can you start by pasting the other comment we were discussing?
[15:08] <k-joseph> checking for it
[15:12] <k-joseph> not seeing that, was it the last question about what i understand by if (this.locationId == null || !this.locationId.getId().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId)) {  ??
[15:13] <dkayiwa> there was a comment before that line
[15:22] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: failing to remember that now, was it  what are you trying to accomplish by this statement? !this.locationId.getClass().getName().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId)
[15:23] <k-joseph> ?
[15:23] <dkayiwa> start with the comment which was before that line. just paste it here
[15:23] <k-joseph> the compiler should be your first reviewer before you send me. unless you fail to fix the compiler error
[15:24] <dkayiwa> i mean the comment in the code
[15:25] <k-joseph>                     //only go ahead if it has actually changed OR if wasn't set before
[15:25] <dkayiwa> so do let us examine that statement
[15:25] <dkayiwa> can you break it into two parts?
[15:27] <k-joseph> if(has actually changed || wasn't set before)
[15:27] <dkayiwa> excellent
[15:28] <dkayiwa> so can you do each part in relation to locationId? and paste here?
[15:35] <k-joseph> if (this.location == null || !this.location.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId)), some how challanged by this logic/code:-(
[15:35] <dkayiwa> does it compile?
[15:36] <k-joseph> it doesn't, ,just pasted the previous line of code, which works with {Object}Location location;
[15:37] <dkayiwa> can you fix the compiler error?
[15:38] <k-joseph> i have tried for several times and still failed that is where my problem is, i ressolved that line of code to if (this.locationId == null ||!this.locationId.getId().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId)) {, and my problem now is fixing that error, from yesturday
[15:38] <dkayiwa> what is the compiler error message?
[15:39] <k-joseph> The method getId() is undefined for the type Integer
[15:39] <dkayiwa> do you understand what the error message means?
[15:39] <k-joseph> yes, i do
[15:39] <dkayiwa> what does it mean?
[15:40] <k-joseph> it requires defining getId(), with Integer object
[15:41] <dkayiwa> so then why do you call a method which does not exist?
[15:43] <k-joseph> does that mean i should have called getName(), in its place, i gives the same identical error message
[15:44] <dkayiwa> what is the class of the object you are dealing with?
[15:48] <k-joseph> not getting that clearly = (Integer ? Integer : beg your pardon)
[15:49] <dkayiwa> what is the class of the object on which yo
[15:50] <k-joseph> UserContext
[15:50] <k-joseph> is the class name where am calliing it from
[15:50] <k-joseph> and the object is
[15:51] <dkayiwa> can you paste here how you are calling the getId() method on an object of that class?
[15:51] <k-joseph> this.locationId.getId()
[15:52] <dkayiwa> and you say that the class of the object on which you are calling the getId method is UserContext?
[15:53] <k-joseph> that is Integer, in that case
[15:53] <dkayiwa> and does the Integer class have a getId method?
[15:56] <k-joseph> it does not have getId()
[15:56] <dkayiwa> so then why are you calling that method when you know it does not have it?
[15:58] <k-joseph> am just getting that logic now, that i should always call the method, on an object that, it is cotained in?
[15:58] <dkayiwa> yes
[15:58] <k-joseph> ok, thanks for that
[15:58] <dkayiwa> so can you now do it again?
[15:59] <k-joseph> trying that again,
[16:17] <k-joseph> is using toString() better, that is what i have in mind, now having gone through Integer class components, 
[16:19] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  what do you exactly want to use it for
[16:20] <k-joseph> replacement  of getName() / getId()
[16:21] <dkayiwa> what i mean is what are you exactly trying to do?
[16:22] <dkayiwa> for instance of i do sqrt(2) i can say am getting the sqaue root of the number 2
[16:22] <dkayiwa> so what are you trying to do?
[16:23] <k-joseph> this.locationId.toString()   trying to Return a String object representing this Integer's value.
[16:24] <dkayiwa> i mean what are you trying to do in relation to the comment in the code before that line?
[16:27] <k-joseph> trying to, ressolve if was not set before, by, !this.locationId.toString().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId)) ??? ?
[16:28] <dkayiwa> and then for the other part of the comment? how do you plan to do it?
[16:31] <k-joseph> was planning to leave the first part as it is, but i think this may not help me get what i want, 
[16:31] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  what do you mean by leave it as it is?
[16:33] <k-joseph> was meaning having this,                     if (this.locationId == null || !this.locationId.toString().equalsIgnoreCase(locationId)) {, it looks already disqualified, so i think it should be done by a diifferent way!!
[16:34] <dkayiwa> the first part is fine and fits in one of the two parts of the comment
[16:34] <dkayiwa> how do you tell if an object's value has been set?
[16:35] <k-joseph> not sure
[16:35] <dkayiwa> can you google it?
[16:35] <k-joseph> doing that
[16:36] <dkayiwa> in otherwards, when you declare an object, what value does it start with?
[16:46] <k-joseph> i think it starts with a default value, like, null, 0, or false,  
[16:47] <dkayiwa> does it start with all the three that you have given?
[16:48] <k-joseph> no, null for objects, false is for boolean variable, and 0 or -0, for int
[16:49] <dkayiwa> so for our case, what value does it start with?
[16:49] <k-joseph>  null
[16:50] <k-joseph>   will be back very soon please, 
[16:50] <dkayiwa> ok tell me when back
[16:50] <k-joseph> will do that 
[16:50] <k-joseph>   will be back very soon please, 
[16:50] <dkayiwa> ok tell me when back
[16:50] <k-joseph> will do that 
[17:30] <k-joseph> we can continue pease, 
[17:30] <dkayiwa> ok
[17:31] <dkayiwa> so what value does our object start with automatically (without us having to give it a value)
[17:31] <dkayiwa> ?
[17:31] <k-joseph> null
[17:31] <dkayiwa> so how do we tell if its value is not set?
[17:32] <k-joseph> when it has a null value
[17:33] <dkayiwa> and how would that look like code wise?
[17:35] <k-joseph> If(locationId == null ? //value not set : //value set), which 
[17:36] <k-joseph> does value not set represent changed, ??
[17:36] <dkayiwa> which of the above two comments should i take?
[17:36] ->> value :Unknown command
[17:37] <k-joseph> value not set for the true side
[17:37] <dkayiwa> value not set means it has not changed
[17:38] <dkayiwa> value not set means it has not changed from the value which was initially automatically assigned by the compiler
[17:38] <dkayiwa> does that make sense?
[17:39] <k-joseph> it does, like null in this case?
[17:39] <dkayiwa> yes
[17:39] <k-joseph> ok, gotten that part, 
[17:40] <dkayiwa> so what is the remaining part of the comment?
[17:40] <k-joseph> if was not set
[17:40] <dkayiwa> paste the comment again here
[17:40] <k-joseph>                     //only go ahead if it has actually changed OR if wasn't set before
[17:41] <dkayiwa> how do we tell if the value was not set?
[17:42] <dkayiwa> or how do we tell if value was set
[17:42] <k-joseph> if it equal to null or a value, then was set, and the opposite is true
[17:43] <dkayiwa> can you put it in code to show how we tell if value wasn't set before?
[17:46] <k-joseph> first here, this.location == null // you said, null represents value was set? are we taking this that at first value wasn't null, so that we can say it has been set to null
[17:46] <k-joseph> originally by compiler
[17:47] <dkayiwa> the comment above whenever it talks of value being set, it means being set by user instead of compiler
[17:47] <dkayiwa> does that make things clearer?
[17:48] <k-joseph> yes it does, then i understand that 
[17:48] <dkayiwa> so can you now put it in code to show how we tell if value wasn't set before?
[17:54] <k-joseph> am not yet well versed with (his.location == null , according to the comment what then was the value that has now changed, this is still confusing me, but am very well interested in answering that question, 
[17:56] <dkayiwa> if location == null, is the value set or not?
[17:57] <k-joseph> i think it is not, or you mean that not being set would be location == ""
[17:57] <k-joseph> ?
[17:58] <k-joseph> for at first it is set to null, while instanciation
[17:58] <dkayiwa> how does the location get a value of "" ?
[17:58] <dkayiwa> how does the location get a value of "" ?
[17:59] <dkayiwa> when we talk of being set we are not refering to the compiler
[17:59] <dkayiwa> i told you that above
[17:59] <dkayiwa> are we together on this?
[18:00] <k-joseph> yes, you did, so at first, nothing is set, right, and now at that line set to null?? ok got that
[18:01] <dkayiwa> so can you now put it in code to show how we tell if value wasn't set before?
[18:04] <k-joseph> !(this.location)
[18:05] <dkayiwa> what does that mean?
[18:06] <k-joseph> means that it is not equal to the current value of location
[18:07] <dkayiwa> whats the current value of location?
[18:07] <k-joseph> null
[18:09] <dkayiwa> so you are comparing the value stored in location and null?
[18:11] <k-joseph> yes, at first location is initialised to null, 
[18:13] <dkayiwa> so can you do the codewise comparison which shows that you are actually comparing the two values?

[12:51] <dkayiwa> so how do we tell if locationId has changed?

[12:51] ->> dkayiwa :End of /WHOIS list.
[12:52] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: we tell if locationId has changed when it is allocated a value, bby the user, thus not null value
[12:53] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  how would that look like in code
[12:54] <k-joseph> this.locationId != null
[12:55] <dkayiwa> so when locationId is not equal to null, it means it was changed?
[12:55] <k-joseph> that is what i think
[12:55] <dkayiwa> ok
[12:56] <dkayiwa> and if it was not changed, what would the code be testing like?
[12:56] <k-joseph> this.locationId == null
[12:56] <dkayiwa> ok
[12:57] <dkayiwa> so thats the part which deals with the portion of the comment which states like: "OR if wasn't set before"
[12:57] <dkayiwa> the remaining being this: "if it has actually changed"
[12:59] <dkayiwa> so we have "this.locationId" and the one which has been got from: this.user.getUserProperty(OpenmrsConstants.USER_PROPERTY_DEFAULT _LOCATION)
[12:59] <dkayiwa> do you see those two?
[13:00] <k-joseph> yes i do
[13:02] <dkayiwa> so do you know how to compare those two values?
[13:03] <k-joseph> tricky for me, like/
[13:04] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  if you have two variables and you want to check if they have equal values (the same), do you know how to?
[13:05] <k-joseph> yes i do, 
[13:05] <dkayiwa> so how would you do it?
[13:09] <k-joseph> if(this.locationId==locationId ? assert "equal" : assert"they are not equal")
[13:11] <dkayiwa> so this translates to: //only go ahead if it has actually changed OR if wasn't set before
[13:11] <dkayiwa> if (this.locationId == null || this.locationId != locationId)
[13:11] <dkayiwa> thats all we have been looking for
[13:12] <dkayiwa> but for that comparison you need to first convert locationId from a string to an int
[13:12] <dkayiwa> ok?
[13:12] <k-joseph> ok, 
[13:12] <dkayiwa> so can you now go ahead?
[13:22] <k-joseph> getting this error Incompatible operand types Integer and String    with if (this.locationId == null || this.locationId != locationId) ressolved it to if (this.locationId == null || !this.locationId.equals(locationId)) {
[13:23] <dkayiwa> did you read my comments well?
[13:23] <k-joseph> had not concidered it, focusing on it now
[13:24] <dkayiwa> ok
[13:36] <k-joseph> notice the need to ressolve the error The method getLocation() is undefined for the type UserContext   in LocationUtility flie under 
[13:36] <k-joseph> public static Location getUserDefaultLocation() {
[13:36] <k-joseph>           return Context.getUserContext().getLocation();
[13:36] <k-joseph>      }
[13:36] <dkayiwa> did you first finish the one we were dealing with?
[13:37] <k-joseph> yes,   it is if (this.locationId == null || this.locationId != Integer.parseInt(locationId)) {
[13:37] <dkayiwa> ok
[13:38] <dkayiwa> now the error you are reporting comes because you removed or changed the getLocation method
[13:38] <dkayiwa> do you get that?
[13:38] <k-joseph> yes i do
[13:38] <k-joseph> uunder UserContext file
[13:39] <dkayiwa> when dealing with API development, we do not change existing API methods
[13:39] <dkayiwa> that is because module developers are already using those APIs and hence changing them would break their modules
[13:39] <dkayiwa> ok?
[13:39] <k-joseph> ok
[13:40] <dkayiwa> so can you change them back?
[13:47] <k-joseph> how, i had not made any changes yet apart from the ones i ihave just done in UserContext.SetUserLoaction, what is do you mean exactly by change existing API methods, was this part of them, and not to be subjected to changes, what am i to do then
[13:50] <k-joseph> tampered with , UserContext.SetUserLoaction()  and field location plus its getter and setter  
[13:51] <dkayiwa> restore the the methods as they were
[13:52] <k-joseph> i have done  that 
[13:55] ->> Attempting to join #Git
[14:15] <k-joseph> hi
[14:15] <dkayiwa> so does it compile
[14:16] <k-joseph> when i restore, do you mean dropping all my added changes, done that and no errors, compiles
[14:17] <k-joseph> are these methods api methods?
[14:21] <dkayiwa> no
[14:21] <dkayiwa> just returning the setLocation and getLocation
[14:21] <dkayiwa> as they were
[14:22] <dkayiwa> does that make sense?
[14:22] <k-joseph> just returning the setLocation and getLocation
[14:22] <k-joseph> [14:21] <dkayiwa> as they were
[14:23] <k-joseph> beg your pardon
[14:23] <dkayiwa> did you touch those two metjods
[14:23] <dkayiwa> methods
[14:23] <k-joseph> yes
[14:28] <k-joseph> i think i had to change the getter and setter of location to much locationId, !!!!!!!!

[14:33] ->> Goto http://www.icechat.net/socket for more Socket Error Information
[14:50] <k-joseph_> meaning i was then supposed to leave private Location location = null;  and its setters and getters as a method component and then create anew set of private Integer locationId = null; is this right??
[14:51] <dkayiwa> first step, change them back to what they were
[14:51] <dkayiwa> then tell me which compiler errors you get
[14:51] <dkayiwa> then i will guide you in how to go about them
[14:53] <k-joseph_> i have done a git stash, and am now back to the step where i had no, chanes,  
[14:58] <k-joseph_> chaned private Location location = null; to private Integer locationId = null;  added my changes to setUserLocation() and now the i 
[14:59] <dkayiwa> do not return the Location object
[14:59] <dkayiwa> because we removed that and replaced it with locationId
[15:00] <dkayiwa> are we together?
[15:01] <k-joseph_> getLocation(returned locationId), now and this is the error, i think we need to apply casting   
[15:01] <k-joseph_> Type mismatch: cannot convert from Integer to Location
[15:02] <dkayiwa> do you know how to get a Location object from a locationId?
[15:02] <k-joseph_> no
[15:02] <dkayiwa> in otherwards if i have a locationId do you know how i fetch its location>
[15:02] <dkayiwa> ?
[15:03] <k-joseph_> no, i dont
[15:04] <k-joseph_> know that
[15:04] <dkayiwa> can you look at the location service
[15:05] <dkayiwa> ?
[15:05] <k-joseph_> locationService file?
[15:05] <dkayiwa> whatever you think is the location service
[15:09] <k-joseph_> looking at location service file
[15:09] <k-joseph_> @Authorized( { PrivilegeConstants.GET_LOCATIONS })
[15:09] <k-joseph_>      public Location getLocation(Integer locationId) throws APIException;
[15:09] <k-joseph_>      
[15:09] <dkayiwa> so can you use that?
[15:53] <k-joseph_> how can i fetch and use loactionId from LocationService, this what am doing
[15:54] <k-joseph_> public Location getLocation() {
[15:54] <k-joseph_>           return LocationService.getLocation(locationId);
[15:54] <dkayiwa> does it take away the compiler error?
[15:54] <k-joseph_> it creates this error, 
[15:54] <k-joseph_> public Location getLocation() {
[15:54] <k-joseph_>           return LocationService.getLocation(locationId);
[15:55] <k-joseph_> Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method getLocation(Integer) from the type LocationService
[15:55] <dkayiwa> do you remember how the original code used to get  a location object from locationId ?
[15:56] <k-joseph_> i dont remember that
[15:58] <dkayiwa> can you check for it on github?
[15:59] <k-joseph_> which one exactly, the fix for  this last error, 
[16:00] <dkayiwa> can you check it here?
[16:00] <dkayiwa> https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/openmrs/api/context/UserContext.java
[16:00] <dkayiwa> as in check to see how it was getting a location object from a locationId
[16:04] <k-joseph_> i have seen that
[16:04] <dkayiwa> ok do it
[16:06] <k-joseph_> return this.locationId;    ?
[16:07] <dkayiwa> am not sure i understand your question
[16:09] <k-joseph_> i mean from github it was return this.location; is this what is required to answer what you mean 
[16:09] <k-joseph_>  to get  a location object from locationId ?
[16:09] <k-joseph_> even now, 
[16:09] <dkayiwa> all i meant was just for you to see how to get a location object from a locationId
[16:07] <dkayiwa> am not sure i understand your question
[16:09] <k-joseph_> i mean from github it wasreturn this.location; is this what is required toanswer what you mean 
[16:09] <k-joseph_>  to get  a location object from locationId ?
[16:09] <k-joseph_> even now, 
[16:09] <dkayiwa> all i meant was just for youto see how to get a location object from a locationId
[18:07] <k-joseph> hi
[18:07] <dkayiwa> hi
[18:09] <k-joseph> using that approach doesn't take the error away, may be am just not sure what to do!1
[18:14] <dkayiwa> what change did you make
[18:15] <k-joseph> forexample my last change is 
[18:15] <k-joseph> public Location getLocation() {
[18:15] <k-joseph>           return this.locationId;
[18:15] <k-joseph>      }
[18:16] <dkayiwa> is that what we agreed upon of how to get a location object from a locationId?
[18:17] <k-joseph> public void setLocation(Location location) {
[18:17] <k-joseph>           this.location = location;
[18:17] <k-joseph>      }
[18:18] <dkayiwa> is that we agreed upon of how to get a location object from a locationId?
[18:20] <k-joseph> that is according to the link, you gave me, then i didnt understand about locationService 
[18:20] <dkayiwa> do you see how they get a location object from a locationId?
[18:21] <dkayiwa> as in from the link i gave you?
[18:21] ->> dkayiwa is ~dkayiwa@h157.n1.ips.mtn.co.ug (Daniel Kayiwa)
[18:21] ->> dkayiwa is on: #openmrs
[18:21] ->> dkayiwa using hobana.freenode.net (Pitesti, RO)
[18:21] ->> dkayiwa :End of /WHOIS list.
[18:22] <k-joseph> is not that like 
[18:22] <k-joseph> public Location getLocation() {
[18:22] <k-joseph>           return this.location;
[18:22] <k-joseph>      }
[18:22] <dkayiwa> is that in the link i gave you?
[18:23] <k-joseph> yes, https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/openmrs/api/context/UserContext.java
[18:23] <dkayiwa> and is it getting a location object from a locationId?
[18:25] <k-joseph> not sure, what you are meaning there please, can you humbly repeat for in clearer form what you are meaning, 
[18:26] <dkayiwa> in that link where i gave you, do you see, by looking at the whole page, anywhere we get a location by passing in a locationId?
[18:27] <k-joseph> this.location = Context.getLocationService().getLocation(Integer.valueOf(locationId));
[18:28] <dkayiwa> exactly
[18:28] <dkayiwa> thats the one which you should use
[18:33] <k-joseph> iam i to change any thing in the getter and setter methods of location previously, and how can i stand with out their respective field variable?
[18:34] <dkayiwa> deal with one thing at a time
[18:34] <dkayiwa> if you deal with the getter, then first finish it before you go to the setter
[18:34] <dkayiwa> ok?
[18:57] <k-joseph> ok, getter:
[18:58] <k-joseph> public Location getLocation() {
[18:58] <k-joseph>           Location location = Context.getLocationService().getLocation(Integer.valueOf(locationId));
[18:58] <k-joseph>           return location;
[18:58] <k-joseph>           return location;
[18:58] <k-joseph>      }
[18:58] <k-joseph> ??
[18:59] <dkayiwa> what is the type for locationId?
[18:59] <k-joseph> Integer
[18:59] <dkayiwa> so what is Integer.valueOf() doing for it?
[19:00] <k-joseph> nothing thing, that was a mistake, i have removed that 
[19:00] <dkayiwa> so how does it now look like?
[19:01] <k-joseph> public Location getLocation() {
[19:01] <k-joseph>           Location location = Context.getLocationService().getLocation(locationId);
[19:01] <k-joseph>           return location;
[19:01] <k-joseph>      }
[19:02] <dkayiwa> looks better
[19:03] <dkayiwa> can you just return it and do not first assign it to a local variable?
[19:03] <k-joseph> doing that
[19:05] ->> Attempting to join ##java
[19:15] <k-joseph> that is tricky, how(A)
[19:15] <k-joseph> ?
[19:15] <dkayiwa> how to do what?
[19:16] <k-joseph> > can you just return it and do not first assign it to a local variable?
[19:16] <dkayiwa> just do: return Context.get........
[19:19] <k-joseph> fine now, will be back after prayers
[19:19] <dkayiwa> ok

[14:53] ->> checkout :Unknown command
[14:53] ->> go :Unknown command
[14:53] <dkayiwa> you start by answering the last question i asked you
[14:54] ->> commands :Unknown command
[14:54] ->> command :Unknown command
[14:54] <k-joseph> what was that, i dont think i remeber it
[14:55] <dkayiwa> irc logs
[14:56] <k-joseph> i think it was via querying was'nt it
[14:56] <dkayiwa> this is a continuous conversation and when i ask, i proceed basing on your response
[14:56] <dkayiwa> check the irc logs
[15:05] <k-joseph> was it can you compare the UUID as the way of checking if is daemon user?
[15:06] <dkayiwa> was that the last one?
[15:06] <dkayiwa> as per the IRC logs?
[15:06] <k-joseph> yes
[15:07] <dkayiwa> which day was that?
[15:08] <k-joseph> 30-jan-2013
[15:09] <dkayiwa> it was a private chat which the logs do not have
[15:09] <dkayiwa> so i will have to repeat it all over
[15:10] <dkayiwa> list some of the properties of a user object
[15:12] <k-joseph> userId, person, systemId, username, secretQuestion, roles, 
[15:12] <dkayiwa> and how do we access them?
[15:13] <k-joseph> through  messages like getter
[15:27] <k-joseph> hi, sorry i meant through methods, like getPerson()
[15:27] <dkayiwa> thats a response to what question?
[15:28] <k-joseph>  and how do we access them?
[15:28] <k-joseph> which was refering to  list some of the properties of a user object
[15:28] <dkayiwa> does the user object have a uuid property?
[15:29] <k-joseph> no, it does not
[15:30] <dkayiwa> how do you tell
[15:30] <dkayiwa> ?
[15:31] <k-joseph> uuid  os not included among the properties, or variables of the user object
[15:31] <dkayiwa> ok
[15:32] <dkayiwa> have you also tried to look at the base classes?
[15:32] <k-joseph> i have looked at BaseOpenmrsMetadata, and it does not as well
[15:33] <dkayiwa> ok
[15:33] <dkayiwa> have you recursively looked at all the base classes up to the topmost?
[15:34] <k-joseph> do you mean by goin on checking the base class of BaseOpenmrsMetadata  and the corresponding
[15:34] <k-joseph> ?
[15:35] <dkayiwa> yes up to the very last topmost
[15:35] <k-joseph> doing that
[15:36] <k-joseph> BaseOpenmrsObject   the base object of BaseOpenmrsMetadata  has the uuid property
[15:36] <dkayiwa> so what does that mean?
[15:37] <k-joseph> i think it means that i can use it in user
[15:37] <dkayiwa> and how would you access it?
[15:40] <k-joseph> BaseOpenmrsObject.getUuid();
[15:41] <dkayiwa> how would you do it in the method you are working on?
[15:48] <k-joseph> the idea is this  daemon == BaseOpenmrsObject.getUuid();
[15:52] <dkayiwa> can you please always use the compiler before you show me????
[16:20] <k-joseph> am getting this wrong, am not supposed to call a non static method, how am i to do this, that is what i had in mind but i have proved itwrong
[16:20] <dkayiwa> if an object has a property, from what you have all along read, how would you access it?
[16:21] <k-joseph> i thought it is through method
[16:21] <dkayiwa> and did you try it?
[16:22] <k-joseph> it is what i have been trying via, the getUuid() but it cant work out since it is not static
[16:23] <dkayiwa> which object are you dealing with?
[16:24] <k-joseph> BaseOpenmrsObject
[16:24] <dkayiwa> is that an object or a class?
[16:25] <k-joseph> a class
[16:25] <k-joseph> !!!!!!!!!!!
[16:26] <dkayiwa> and did i ask class or object?
[16:28] <k-joseph> sorry, am dealing with daemon
[16:28] <k-joseph> how about this 
[16:28] <k-joseph> public boolean isDaemonUser(User daemon) {
[16:28] <k-joseph>           return daemon.toString() == daemon.getUuid();
[16:28] <k-joseph>      }
0[16:28] <k-joseph> sorry, am dealing with daemon
[16:28] <k-joseph> how about this 
[16:28] <k-joseph> public boolean isDaemonUser(User daemon) {
[16:28] <k-joseph>           return daemon.toString() == daemon.getUuid();
[16:28] <k-joseph>      }
[16:29] <dkayiwa> does it compile?
[16:29] <k-joseph> checking...............
[16:34] <k-joseph> runs, since the other time, mvn clean install stopped working, that is still a problem to me
[16:35] <dkayiwa> what was the last think i told you about you asking me something and consulting your compiler?
[16:40] <k-joseph> i should always check the compiler first, there are no errors in the code, but i thought you meant compiring the whole openmrs by runningmvn clean install
[16:41] <dkayiwa> i do not expect you to asking me something like, "should it be this???....." before you consult your compiler. Is that clear?
[16:42] <k-joseph> yes it is
[16:42] <dkayiwa> so do you know what a toString method does?
[16:43] <k-joseph> public boolean isDaemonUser(User daemon) {
[16:43] <k-joseph>           return daemon.toString() == daemon.getUuid();
[16:43] <k-joseph>      }
[16:43] <dkayiwa> did you understand my question?
[16:43] <k-joseph> Returns a string equal to the value of: 
[16:43] <dkayiwa> what?
[16:44] <k-joseph> returns a string equal to daemon
[16:45] <dkayiwa> is that the meaning of a toString method?
[16:49] <k-joseph> it returns username, under User class
[16:50] <dkayiwa> so are you trying to compare username and uuid?
[16:52] <k-joseph> am supposed to compare daemon and uuid
[16:52] <dkayiwa> which ticket number is that?
[16:55] <k-joseph> sorry for the delay it is TRUNK-3424
[16:55] <dkayiwa> !ticket  TRUNK-3424
[16:58] <dkayiwa> one is a daemon user if their uuid is equal to that of a daemon user
[17:04] <k-joseph> :-(
[17:10] <k-joseph> ????????
[17:10] <dkayiwa> meaning?e() == daemon.getUuid();  "
[17:14] <k-joseph> ?
[17:15] <dkayiwa> can you paste here my statement again?
[17:15] <k-joseph> one is a daemon user iftheir uuid is equal to that of a daemon user
[17:17] <k-joseph> i need to do some physical work before the sabbath, thanks a lot for all the assistance, i think i will pick up from there, if you only allowme ?
[17:18] <dkayiwa> ok no problem
[17:18] <dkayiwa> see you next time and thanks for your time!!!
[17:18] <k-joseph> thanks a lot and may God bless you, happy Sabbath
[15:34] <k-joseph> do you mean by goin onchecking the base class of BaseOpenmrsMetadat

[20:53] <dkayiwa> Amen!!! We surely had a blessed Sabbath. May you too have a week full of God's blessings!!!

[21:17] <k-joseph> we had stopped on this statement on friday
[21:17] <k-joseph>    <dkayiwa> one is a daemon user if their uuid is equal to that of a daemon user
[21:18] <dkayiwa> ok. and how do you understand that?
[21:19] <k-joseph> that for the user to be a daemon one, his uuid should be equal to the daemon uuid
[21:28] <k-joseph> hi
[21:29] <dkayiwa> and how would that look like codewise?
[21:29] <k-joseph> daemon.getUsername() == daemon.getUuid();
[21:30] <dkayiwa> are username and uuid meaning the same thing?
[21:30] <k-joseph> no
[21:31] <dkayiwa> then why do you have something like that?
[21:43] <k-joseph> i now understand what the statement meant, ,compairing uuid values
[21:44] <k-joseph> daemon.toString() == daemon.getUuid();
[21:44] <dkayiwa> what does toString do?
[21:45] <k-joseph> returns uuid, overiden from baseopenmrsobject class
[21:47] <dkayiwa> have you googled about what toString() method does for objects?
[21:49] <k-joseph> am refering to the one written in the code, not the one at java.lang.Object
[21:50] <k-joseph> one located in baseopenmrsobject class
[21:50] <dkayiwa> do you know what property setters and getters are used for?
[21:51] <k-joseph> to set values for variables or properties and to return the set values
[21:52] <dkayiwa> so what are you comparing now?
[21:53] <k-joseph> the user's uuid, with the daemon uuid
[21:54] <dkayiwa> and is that how they access a user's uuid?
[21:54] <k-joseph> i think i need your assistance there
[21:55] <dkayiwa> how do we access the object's uuid?
[21:55] <k-joseph> objectname.getuuid()
[21:56] <dkayiwa> and is that how you are accessing it in the code you showed me a few moments ago?
[21:57] <k-joseph> daemon.getuuid(), am just not yet sure how i can the user uuid which am supposed to compare with that
[21:59] <dkayiwa> can you again paste here the statement we are trying to translate into code?
[22:00] <k-joseph> one is adaemon user if their uuid is equal to that of a daemon user
[22:01] <dkayiwa> and do you know the uuid value for a daemon user?
[22:02] <k-joseph> yes, it is A4F30A1B-5EB9-11DF-A648-37A07F9C90FB
[22:01] <dkayiwa> and do you know the uuid value for a daemon user?
[22:02] <k-joseph> yes, it is A4F30A1B-5EB9-11DF-A648-37A07F9C90FB
[22:02] <dkayiwa> so how do we tell if one is a daemon user
[22:03] <k-joseph> daemon.getUuid() == "A4F30A1B-5EB9-11DF-A648-37A07F9C90FB"
[22:03] <k-joseph> if that is true
[22:03] <dkayiwa> does it compile?
[22:11] <k-joseph> it does compile
[22:18] <dkayiwa> can you create a unit test for that method?

[12:40] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: hi
[12:45] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  hi
[12:46] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  your unit test naming does not seem to be in line with our convention
[12:47] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  secondly, you need two tests: One where the method should return true and the other where the same method should returnfalse
[12:47] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: does it require me to add @should in Daemon class
[12:48] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  you need to learn from what you have been doing in the past, before asking
[12:49] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  just look at your past commits and you will understand

[13:39] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: how is this TRUNK-3289 ??
[13:39] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  in the javadoc, i do not see the method description (as in what the method does)
[13:40] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  secondly, why do you hard code the uuid?
[13:41] <k-joseph> dkayiwa:  secondly, why do you hard code the uuid?  
[13:41] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: what are you meaning?
[13:41] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  why
[13:42] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  do you remember the docs i sent you about constants?
[13:42] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i do
[13:43] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  so do i now make sense?
[13:43] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: not yet
[13:44] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: on hard coding
[13:44] <dkayiwa> k-joseph: its about the constants docs i sent

[23:00] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  ok
[23:01] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: do you mean it fine to make a pull request?
[23:02] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  in the isDaemonUser method, can you do the reverse?
[23:02] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  DAEMON_USER_UUID.equals(......)
[23:02] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  that will prevent the NPE if the uuid is null
[23:02] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  does this make sense?
[23:02] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  does this make sense?
[23:03] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: what is NPE
[23:03] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  Null Pointer Exception
[23:05] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: am not fully getting this can you do the reverse?
[23:05] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  if the uuid is null, do you see that the method call will throw a NPE?
[23:07] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: so can i just use a catch block to take care of this, or there i sa better way?
[23:08] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  and easier way is it reverse the statement
[23:08] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  as i mentioned above
[23:11] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: how is that to be done? 
[23:12] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: daemon.getUuid().equals(DAEMON_USER_UUID) || daemon.getUuid().equals(null)  ??
[23:12] <dkayiwa> k-joseph: do you see my statement above?
[23:13] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i see that 
[23:13] <k-joseph> k-joseph:  in the isDaemonUser method, can you do the reverse?
[23:13] <k-joseph> [23:02] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  DAEMON_USER_U UID.equals(......)
[23:13] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  yes use that to do the comparison
[23:18] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: am failing to figure out how exactly you want me to do that
[23:19] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  do you see where you do the equals comparison in that method?
[23:19] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i do see that
[23:20] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  can you replace it my statement above and then you finish it?
[23:22] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: am sorry to say but am not understanding that, 
[23:23] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  have you first of all done the replacement?
[23:26] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: daemon.getUuid().DAEMON_USER_UUID.equals(DAEMON_USER_UUID)
[23:26] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  does that compile?

[23:36] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: ok, i have got what you meant, 
[23:37] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: return DAEMON_USER_UUID.equals(daemon.getUuid());
[23:37] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  thats exactly what i wanted. how did you figure it out?
[23:38] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i just had to remeber how the equals() is to be used
[23:38] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  ok
[23:39] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  what is the advantage of that over the one you have committed?
[23:40] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i dont think i can prove the advantage, bu tfrom what i have had from you, this conciders DAEMON_USER_UUID being null as well
[23:41] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  what do you mean by DAEMON_USER_UUID being null?
[23:42] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i mean daemon uuid == null
[23:42] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  can't DAEMON_USER_UUID also be null?
[23:43] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: DAEMON_USER_UUID is the same as daemon uuid
[23:43] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  what do you mean by saying that they are the same?
[23:43] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: it can be null when there is no value that is initially assigned to it 
[23:46] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: it looks like, DAEMON_USER_UUID is the in defined uuid for daemon, d
[23:43] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: DAEMON_USER_UUID is the same as daemon uuid
[23:43] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  what do you mean by saying that they are the same?
[23:43] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: it can be null when there is no value that is initially assigned to it 
[23:46] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: it looks like, DAEMON_USER_UUID is the in defined uuid for daemon, does that mean that a daemon user can have a user defined universally unique id  ?
[23:47] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  not all users are daemon
[23:47] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  and in that case can you also change the parameter name?
[23:48] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  you gave the parameter the name daemon. but that does not make sense since the user may not be a daemon
[23:48] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  do you agree?
[23:49] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: yes i do, practically how can i create a daemon user account, besides modifying the availabe daemon account 
[23:50] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: am naming the parameter daemonUsername
[23:50] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  which data type is that parameter?
[23:50] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: User
[23:50] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  so is that a user name?
[23:51] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: so daemonUser, is what am using
[23:51] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  will all of them be daemons?
[23:52] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: do you mean all users
[23:52] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  all parameters to that method
[23:52] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: not neccessarily
[23:53] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  so then why do you call it daemon???
[23:57] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: http://pastebin.com/0zHmmXEj
[23:58] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  you did not complete the javadoc for the @param
[23:59] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  also for the method description, can you use capitalization whenever it should be?
[00:00] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  that is only for the method description
[00:01] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: @param user, User
[00:03] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: http://pastebin.com/cxD3xGdm
[00:04] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  the method javadoc is still missing on capitalizations and full stops
[00:05] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  the @param is still incomplete. you can just look at existing openmrs methods that have javadoc, for an example
[00:05] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  the capitalization and full stops are for method description

[00:51] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: hi
[00:51] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  make User start with small u
[00:52] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  also the @param and @return should not have implementation details
[00:52] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  that is, they should not tell the method user that we are actually using uuid to check for daemoness
[00:53] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  does that make sense?
[00:53] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: it does
[01:01] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: http://pastebin.com/07WkGN1d
[01:02] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  ok now commit
[01:05] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  did you also make DAEMON_USER_UUID public?
[01:05] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: no
[01:06] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  do you see the ticket title?
[01:06] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i had forgotten that, am goin to do that
[01:06] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  ok
[01:07] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  after committing, you should also create a new ticket for someone to handle Burke's request which goes as below:
[01:07] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  Can we filter daemon user from user-related API methods – i.e., getting users or searching users would not include thedaemon user in results?

[13:46] <+suranga> dkayiwa, mm... how shall I google for what you are suggesting ? :)
[13:46] <dkayiwa> k-joseph: try assign typedValue to null. then make the call typedValue.getUuid()
[13:47] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: do you intend i use some thing like if (typedValue==null) return null;

[23:20] <rfriedman> what rafa has done is focused on combining rest and rest19, which is a major goal

[14:02:21] <k-joseph> currently using linux, uganda telecom and it is fine, only that i have been using win and it could not show signal in my mobile partner, but it is good, 
[14:02:48] <dkayiwa> and 100MB at 250 only?
[14:03:01] <k-joseph> yes
[14:03:10] <dkayiwa> thats too cheap
[14:03:57] <k-joseph> also 1/= per sec call utl i have just called mum and we have talked for 10mins, i thank God
[14:04:00] <k-joseph> for that
[14:05:26] <dkayiwa> oh thats so so good!!!
[14:05:45] <dkayiwa> so you mean a minute is just 60 shs?
[14:05:57] <k-joseph> yes
[14:06:09] <dkayiwa> yike!!!
[14:06:14] <dkayiwa> how long is the promotion?

[14:06:22] <k-joseph> am not sure
[14:07:08] <dkayiwa> ok
[14:10:05] <k-joseph> even mint is good, i have liked it more than win,

[14:11:26] <k-joseph> linux distribution, version
[14:17:03] <dkayiwa> oh i see
[14:19:31] <k-joseph> what do you think am currently thinking about now, that is using linux in most of my projects if not all, what is your suggestion?
[14:20:02] <dkayiwa> linux is better than windows (for me) :)
[14:21:35] <k-joseph> so dont you think it is better to re-install all these required softwares as quick as possible so that i can switch to use linux even for openmrs, ?
[14:22:47] <k-joseph> it solving lots of issues am used of experiencing while using win7
[14:23:09] <dkayiwa> i fully agree
[14:23:33] <dkayiwa> when i need windows, i run it under a VM
[14:23:34] <k-joseph> ok, am now beginning to install them
[14:23:36] <dkayiwa> virtual box
[14:23:38] <dkayiwa> ok

[21:39:31] <rfriedman> mseaton1, hi
[21:40:06] <mseaton1> rfriedman: hey
[21:40:31] <rfriedman> mseaton,  hey, I was at a seminar this morning and got to wondering if we did anything in reporting to optimize queries
[21:40:49] <mseaton1> rfriedman: example?
[21:41:36] <rfriedman> mseaton, for example, in composition cohorts using AND, do we evaluate both sides and then AND them or do we AND the cohorts, do the left side and then do the right side on the result
[21:42:09] <rfriedman> mseaton, excuse, not clear
[21:42:31] <mseaton1> rfriedman: in the current implementation we evaluate each query in full (on the base cohort supplied), and then intersect/union/etc in java
[21:42:52] <rfriedman> option 1: calculate left side on its cohort, calculate right side on its cohort, then AND the cohorts
[21:43:01] <-- mseaton (~mseaton@209.156.249.193) has quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[21:43:16] <mseaton1> rfriedman: this could be changed if it were more efficient to reduce down base cohort as we go, but the tradeoff would be that caching would potentially be lost
[21:43:21] <-> mseaton1 is now known as mseaton
[21:44:16] <rfriedman> mseaton1, ok, yes, but which is more important?  or can we make it an option?
[21:44:42] <mseaton> rfriedman: for example, right now if you do male + adult, then male + children, then female + adult, then female + children, you can reuse male, female, adult, child cached results as you go
[21:45:21] <-- rowanseymour (~textual@196.44.240.59) has quit (Quit: Computer has gone to sleep.)
[21:45:38] <rfriedman> mseaton, or what about, if you have A and B, and the criteria of A are more likely to eliminate patients than the criteria of B, make sure that A is done first
[21:45:39] <mseaton> rfriedman: certainly could be modified to support the other approach.  not sure how to make it configurable at runtime.  a different implementation of a CompositionCohortDefinitionEvaluator could do it differently easily
[21:46:30] <mseaton> rfriedman: yes, if that were something that could be detected.
[21:46:45] <rfriedman> mseaton, what about things that can be done with the same table, like males >18, is there a way to handle that?
[21:47:15] <rfriedman> mseaton, DBs keep statistics for query optimization, we could also
[21:48:08] <mseaton> rfriedman: yes, good point.  would be interesting to design in a way to store statistics around which queries are run most often, how long they take to run, etc.
[21:48:53] <rfriedman> mseaton, i think it would be more table-based: count of encounters by encounter type; count of obs by id-value for coded obs
[21:49:46] <rfriedman> mseaton, if we create an index on what we're interested in, the counts come with no DB accesses, only index accesses

[21:52:17] <mseaton> rfriedman:  the intention behind our design in the reporting module is to provide the framework for plugging in "definitions" and "evaluators" to produce "results", and then various tools around those.  and so far, some bad UIs around them too.  and when i have written many of the evaluators that are in place now, my goal often has been to get a reasonably efficient starting pass out the door that produces the right result, and then allowing us to iterat
[21:53:38] <rfriedman> mseaton, understand, np, just had this idea, thought i wld pass it on
[21:53:56] <mseaton> rfriedman: yeah, i'm on board.  hopefully contributers with good db chops can get into that code and make it faster.
[21:54:10] <mseaton> rfriedman: or design alternative techniques (data warehousing, indexing, etc) that can improve things

[17:31:12] <k_joseph> dkayiwa: am trying to clone openmrs though it is breaking down on the way due to small bundle probs, i think i need to do this on a further more stable connection, on the part of sharing openmrs projects in eclipse, what do you think is the cause for me to miss having git as an option to select?

[17:33:29] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: yes
[17:34:52] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  did you install the git eclipse plugin?
[17:35:35] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i installed Egit
[17:39:29] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  can you try update the plugin?

[18:40:39] <rafa> wyclif: the thing about RESTWS-267
[18:40:43] <wyclif> hi rafa
[18:40:56] <rafa> wyclif: I can't think of a way to parallelize the work between devs
[18:41:03] <rafa> wyclif: so even if we create sub-tasks
[18:41:11] <rafa> wyclif: we will need to go with them one by one
[18:41:21] <rafa> wyclif: meaning most likely one dev will do it
[18:41:48] <rafa> wyclif: I was hoping you would go for it all!
[18:42:00] <rafa> wyclif: it's either you or me actually
[18:42:01] <wyclif> rafa, correct but you can see that i have worked on concept source without depending on another ticket, someone in this time could have been working on concept map type in the ematime
[18:42:25] <wyclif> rafa, because concept map type and source and not related
[18:42:44] <wyclif> rafa, i undertand some can't be done in parallel
[18:43:11] --> rfriedman (~rfriedman@adsl-074-251-137-165.sip.asm.bellsouth.net) has joined #openmrs
[18:43:20] <wyclif> rafa, but it is still nice to break down work into smaller units to promote the idea of committing early
[18:43:35] <rfriedman> wyclif, anything i can do to help with this?
[18:43:37] <rafa> wyclif: Ohh you do can commit early :)
[18:43:51] <rafa> wyclif: how often you need
[18:44:25] <rafa> wyclif: my point is we could parallelize it only between you and me
[18:44:32] <wyclif> rafa, sure
[18:44:37] <rfriedman> probably makes sense, i ended up working on this ticket for a month
[18:44:39] <rafa> wyclif: and it's not really worth it
[18:44:55] <rfriedman> the opposite of frequent commits
[18:45:10] <rafa> wyclif: running into conflicts, etc...
[18:45:42] <rafa> wyclif: if you don't like this ticket anymore I can take it over
[18:46:02] <rafa> wyclif: you could try wih RESTWS-350 for instance
[18:46:04] <wyclif> rafa, i know i didnt read the ticket description well which is my fault, but i just assumed this ticket was mainly about exposing concept resource
[18:46:05] <rfriedman> rafa, we'll give you 2 hours for it
[18:46:14] <rafa> rfriedman: haha :D
[18:46:18] <rafa> rfriedman: you're so generous
[18:46:30] <wyclif> so that means i can continue with something else and assume concept source is done, right rafa
[18:46:49] <rafa> wyclif: right, concept source looks good
[18:46:58] <rafa> wyclif: I can take it over from here
[18:47:12] <rafa> wyclif: and free RESTWS-350 for you if you want
[18:48:45] <rafa> wyclif: if you feel like you need to score more tickets you can go with Fix... test as well :D
[18:49:23] <rafa> wyclif: they are like 20 minutes of work now
[18:49:55] <wyclif> i can can do concept map type as you do concept reference term source
[18:50:06] <wyclif> rafa, i can can do concept map type as you do concept reference term source
[18:50:42] <wyclif> rafa, and then one of us can finish reference terms and mapping since they depend on each other
[18:50:55] <rafa> wyclif: cool
[18:51:07] <rafa> wyclif: would you mind creating these 3 subtasks?
[18:51:30] <wyclif> rafa, i will create the sub tickets and set the depencency

[00:35:20] <andreap_> wyclif: pastebin.com/zR1TsGn1
[00:36:38] <wyclif> andreap_, you still have calls to getUuid() in your code, replace all of them with the uuid variable
[00:36:54] <wyclif> andreap_, just for the test method, replace them
[00:37:09] <andreap_> wyclif, they are commented ou
[00:38:53] <wyclif> andreap_, there are two problems
[00:39:32] <andreap_> wyclif: what are they?
[00:40:09] <wyclif> andreap_, first of all your last assert is wrong it should assertNull because you have purged the concept class, second i recall saying that you need to copy the uuid value in the commented out purge method
[00:40:32] <wyclif> andreap_, the one you are currently using isnt the one, so that is probably a concept class in use
[00:42:18] <andreap_> wyclif, was looking at wrong purge method - too many comments
[00:43:16] <wyclif> andreap_, basically your first assert should check that there is a concept class with that uuid and the second/last one should check that there is no concept class with that uuid since you have just deleted with a ws call
[00:44:14] <andreap_> wyclif, I understand

[01:18:18] <andreapat> wyclif: running mvn -X clean install - see no omod/target
[01:18:57] <wyclif> andreap_, you are working on concept class and not concept source, i said copy the code from conceptsource controller test but you were supposed to make the necessary edits sothat you deal with concept class and not source
[01:19:44] <wyclif> andreap_, even the name of your test method is wrong, it should say concept class and no source
[01:22:17] <andreapat> wyclif, I mentioned that earlier in pastebin - so cange name to shouldPurgeAConceptClass()
[01:23:08] <wyclif> andreap_, ofcourse you are dealing with concept class, even you calls in the method are saying concept source which is wrong and this why tour tests are failing
[01:23:26] <andreapat> wyclif - really confuse - did we change that yesterday?
[01:25:15] <wyclif> andreap_, but you are dealing with concept class, you should't mention concept source anywhere in that code
[01:26:22] <wyclif> andreap_, i just said your code should lok like that in conceptsource but should be exactly the same, can you add here the pastebin of the entire test class
[01:29:52] <andreapat> wyclif: http://pastebin.com/h69WCrAb
[01:32:49] <wyclif> andreap_, rename your test method to say concept class and not source, you also need to edit the code in it to deal with concept class and not concept source, so you get what i mean?
[01:33:38] <wyclif> andreap_, it is the reason it is failing, you are looking up and purging a concept source instead of a concept class which is completely different from what we are testing
[01:34:25] <wyclif> andreap_, you probably copied and pasted and forgot to rename things in that test
[01:35:08] <andreap_> wyclif, changed names  under // ConceptClass - do you see that?

[01:39:34] <wyclif> andreap_, can you closely look at the code in your purge test method, you should see that you are looking up/purging a concept source which is wrong, that test class is entirely for concept classes

[14:53:55] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  different versions of maven is not the same as the number of folders you see in there :)
[14:55:04] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: ok, how of then can i tell the number versions from there?
[14:55:21] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  ok pause that for a moment and do this
[14:55:32] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  can you delete all those folder you have listed and try again
[14:55:40] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  then tell me what happens
[14:56:00] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: try mvn clean install?
[14:56:51] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i have deleted all of them 
[14:57:03] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  yes
[14:57:09] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: ok
[14:57:11] <dkayiwa> hi rafa
[14:57:12] <rafa> dkayiwa: hi
[14:57:58] <dkayiwa> rafa: do you why git pull --rebase upstream 1.9.x would result into conflicts after i have done git reset --hard?
[14:58:06] <rafa> dkayiwa: git reset --hard resets to your latest local commit
[14:58:51] <dkayiwa> rafa: as in when i do git pull --rebase upstream 1.9.x, i get conflicts
[14:58:51] <rafa> dkayiwa: probably you committed something that is in conflict with what you can find in upstream 1.9.x
[14:58:51] <rafa> dkayiwa: you can do hard reset to upstream 1.9.x
[14:58:51] <dkayiwa> rafa:  ok thanks
[14:59:04] <rafa> dkayiwa: np
[15:04:09] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: running currently, again how would i tell the version number from there, besides just determining  them by how many i have installed or setup?
[15:04:39] <dkayiwa> k-joseph:  did you uninstall the previous one before you installed the new one?
[15:05:19] <k-joseph> dkayiwa: i actually uninstalled the previous after installing the current one

[18:42:56] <wyclif> rafa, ok
[18:43:05] <rafa> wyclif: we need to fix OpenmrsConstaints.OPENMRS_VERSION for jetty
[18:43:06] <wyclif> rafa, i know how to get around the jetty issue
[18:43:06] <rafa> wyclif: but that is in core
[18:43:30] <dkayiwa> rafa:  didn't you fix OpenmrsConstaints.OPENMRS_VERSION in some ticket?
[18:43:49] <rafa> dkayiwa: I've seen a ticket about it
[18:43:57] <rafa> dkayiwa: I don't think it was me who fixed it
[18:44:03] <dkayiwa> rafa: :)
[18:44:04] <rafa> dkayiwa: and apparently the fix doesn't work
[18:44:11] <dkayiwa> rafa:  oh
[18:44:23] <rafa> dkayiwa: can you investigate please?
[18:44:29] <dkayiwa> rafa: ok
[18:44:35] <rafa> dkayiwa: thanks
[18:44:38] <dkayiwa> rafa:  from the same ticket?
[18:45:09] <dkayiwa> rafa: can you remind me of the ticket number?
[18:45:24] <rafa> dkayiwa: I'd love, but I don't remember :)
[18:45:32] <dkayiwa> rafa:  :D
